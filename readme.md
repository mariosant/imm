Imm is a set of tools to help you simplify your reducers. It works with all flux-style architectures, including Redux, Recompose's `withReducer` and React's `useReducer` hook.

## Installation

Just add `@mariosant/imm` to your `package.json`.

```bash
$ npm install @mariosant/imm

# or
$ yarn add @mariosant/imm
```

You can now import the module and use it like

```javascript
import { createReducer, when } from '@mariosant/imm';

// or if you are on node or browserify
const { createReducer, when } = require('@mariosant/imm');
```

## Usage

Using imm is pretty straightforward and simple. All it requires, is to dispatch actions that comply with the [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action).

```javascript
import { createReducer, when } from '@mariosant/imm';

const initialState = {};

const reducer = createReducer([
	when('SET_NAME', (state, { payload }) => ({ ...state, name: payload })),
	when('SET_EMAIL', (state, { payload }) => ({ ...state, email: payload })),
], initialState);
```

or even better:

```javascript
import { createAction, createReducer, when, select } from '@mariosant/imm';
const SET_NAME = 'SET_NAME';
const SET_EMAIL = 'SET_EMAIL';

const initialState = {};

const setUserNameAction = createAction(SET_NAME);
const setUserName = (state, { payload }) =>
	select(['user', 'name'], _name => payload, state);

// dot notation for paths work as well
const setUserEmailAction = createAction(SET_EMAIL);
const setUserEmail = (state, { payload }) =>
	select('user.email', _email => payload, state);

const reducer = createReducer([
	when(SET_NAME, setUserName),
	when(SET_EMAIL, setUserEmail),
], initialState);
```

The first argument passed to `when`, can be a `String` or a `Function`. If it is a `String`, it compares it with the `type` of your dispatched action. If it is an `actionCreator`, it uses it to get its type and executes the associated transfomer.

Here is an example.

```javascript
import { createReducer, when, createAction } from '@mariosant/imm';
import { propEq } from 'ramda';

const email = createAction('SET_EMAIL');

const setName = (state, { payload }) => ({ ...state, name: payload });
const setEmail = (state, { payload }) => ({ ...state, email: payload });
const setAge = (state, { payload }) => ({ ...state, age: payload });

const reducer = createReducer(when('SET_NAME', setName), when(email, setEmail));
```

By using this paradigm, you have less things to worry about. You don't have to care about multiple return statements and you only have to test your transformers and if you use the feature, your predicates,

## Development

Easy enough!

```bash
$ yarn install  # to install dependencies
$ yarn test     # to run the test suite
```
